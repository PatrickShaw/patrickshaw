## Quick rules
- Favour immutability: Keep state as encapsulated as possible
- Encapsulated state: Where mutable state is unavoidable, ensure it is strictly encapsulated and its scope is minimized.
- Contextual comments: Use comments to explain *why* a particular piece of code exists, especially
for complex logic or business rules. Do not use comments to explain *what* the
code does if the code itself is clear.
- D.R.Y rule of threes: If you have repeated a sequence of code three or more
times, consider refactoring to remove the duplication.
- No magic numbers: Numbers with semantic meaning attached to them should always
be assigned to and used as a variable (E.g. `MAX_RETRIES = 3`)
- Avoid micro-optimizations: Focus on understandable, readable code first and
foremost.
- No boat anchors/YAGNI: Avoid defensive programming and "just in case" code paths
- Fail fast: Where appropriate, avoid silencing errors by swallowing or falling
back on defaults. Instead, be explicit about the code conveys that "this is
an error" and handle it as such at a scope that can handle the error best.
- Single Responsibility: Each function, class, or module should have one, and
only one, reason to change.
- Explicit Dependencies: Avoid hidden dependencies like globals or singletons. Instead, make dependencies explicit by passing them as arguments or through dependency injection.
- Incorporate SOLID principles into code (Single Responsibility Principle,
Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation
Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle)
