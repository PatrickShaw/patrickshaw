## Quick rules
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Minimize the use of `throw` and `try-catch`. If an error needs to be
propagated out of a method opt for returning. If a particular error needs to be
caught, catch that specific error and throw the rest. 
- Avoid truthy evaluation of `undefined` and/or null. Opt for `myVariable ===
undefined` and `myVariable === null` instead.
- Use `??` instead of `||` where possible
- You can use `null as unknown as <TypeBeingTested> satisfies <TypeItNeedsToAbideBy>` as a means of writing a
"test" to ensure one type satisfies the requirements of another.
- Prefer `as unknown` to `as any` 
- Prefer `/** */` or `/* */` to multiple `//`s when a comment spans more than 1
line
- Prefer using `type` over `interface`
- Prefer `satisfies` over `as`
- When an argument's type definition is very complex but the method only uses a
small subset of fields on that type, use `Pick<MyType, ...>` in the argument
type definition to only include the fields the method uses.
- Prefer `| undefined` over `?:` in argument types unless the intention is to
optimize for developer convenience and worrying about accidentally omitting a
parameter is not a risk.
- Preference `globalThis` over `window` or `global`
